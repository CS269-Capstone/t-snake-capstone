# CS269 Capstone: 

# Capstone-Integration
This repository will contain the functional t-snake implementation augmented with the inpainting GAN.

## Installation
Go to the folder containing all the code and type:
```
pip install -e .
```
where ```-e``` means install in editable (dev) mode.

## Usage
Running this project requires an installation of Jupyter Notebook. Installation instructions are available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

Open a Jupyter Notebook in this directory, and then navigate to ```notebooks```, and open ```Snake-Evolution-Tests```. Run all cells to observe program output.


## How to submit code:
This information is referenced from the Editing in a temporary branch header [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19pY7Lvf4Qnqd8n2r_5DisdZURmBsU94rxcJ4A-VnEp8).

### Steps to success [safe way, pull requests]:
```
git pull master
git checkout -b [branch name if new branch] or git checkout [branch name] # branch name should just be your first name, i.e. allen, cole, eric, joe
git pull [branch name]
```
* Do some work ... time passes ... come back later ... do more work
* Now I want to push some work
```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout [branch name that you've been working on]
git rebase -i master
# Resolve merge conflicts in your editor of choice, VS code handles this pretty nicely
# IMPORTANT! make sure everything now runs as expected
git push [-u # if this is your first push on your branch] [branch name]
# Some time passes, pull request approved! 
git pull master
git checkout [your branch]
git rebase -i master # this step should do nothing ideally, if it does main has diverged from your branch again, which is also ok
```
* Do more great work
* Rinse and repeat 

### Steps to success [the unsafe way, shouldn't really do this but we can]: 
```
git pull master
git checkout -b [branch name if new branch] or git checkout [branch name]
# Do some work ... time passes ... come back later ... do more work
# Now I want to push some work
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout [branch name that you've been working on]
git rebase -i master
# Resolve merge conflicts in your editor of choice, VS code handles this pretty nicely
# IMPORTANT! make sure everything now runs as expected
git checkout master
git merge [your branch]
git push
```

An open source framework for generative image inpainting task, with the support of [Contextual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892) (CVPR 2018) and [Gated Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03589) (ICCV 2019 Oral).

**For the code of previous version (DeepFill v1), please checkout branch [v1.0.0](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting/tree/v1.0.0).**

Free-form image inpainting results by our system built on gated convolution. Each triad shows original image, free-form input and our result from left to right.

## Run

0. Requirements:
    * Install python3.
    * Install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) (tested on Release 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0).
    * Install tensorflow toolkit [neuralgym](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/neuralgym) (run `pip install git+https://github.com/JiahuiYu/neuralgym`).
1. Training:
    * Prepare training images filelist and shuffle it ([example](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting/issues/15)).
    * Modify [inpaint.yml](/inpaint.yml) to set DATA_FLIST, LOG_DIR, IMG_SHAPES and other parameters.
    * Run `python train.py`.
2. Resume training:
    * Modify MODEL_RESTORE flag in [inpaint.yml](/inpaint.yml). E.g., MODEL_RESTORE: 20180115220926508503_places2_model.
    * Run `python train.py`.
3. Testing:
    * Run `python test.py --image examples/input.png --mask examples/mask.png --output examples/output.png --checkpoint model_logs/your_model_dir`.
4. Still have questions?
    * If you still have questions (e.g.: How filelist looks like? How to use multi-gpus? How to do batch testing?), please first search over closed issues. If the problem is not solved, please open a new issue.

## Pretrained models

[Places2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y7Irxm3HSHGvp546hZdAZwuNmhLUVcjO?usp=sharing) | [CelebA-HQ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uvcDgMer-4hgWlm6_G9xjvEQGP8neW15?usp=sharing)

Download the model dirs and put it under `model_logs/` (rename `checkpoint.txt` to `checkpoint` because google drive automatically add ext after download). Run testing or resume training as described above. All models are trained with images of resolution 256x256 and largest hole size 128x128, above which the results may be deteriorated. We provide several example test cases. Please run:

```bash
# Places2 512x680 input
python test.py --image examples/places2/case1_input.png --mask examples/places2/case1_mask.png --output examples/places2/case1_output.png --checkpoint_dir model_logs/release_places2_256
# CelebA-HQ 256x256 input
# Please visit CelebA-HQ demo at: jhyu.me/deepfill
```

**Note:** Please make sure the mask file completely cover the masks in input file. You may check it with saving a new image to visualize `cv2.imwrite('new.png', img - mask)`.

## TensorBoard

Visualization on [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) for training and validation is supported. Run `tensorboard --logdir model_logs --port 6006` to view training progress.
